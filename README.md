## ✨ Key Features

- **🫁 Animated Anatomic Lungs:** Smooth, 3D-ish SVG lungs that organically expand and contract, guiding your breath rate visually.
- **🎨 Dynamic "Level-Up" Themes:** The UI evolves as you progress through rounds. Colors shift from grounding Green, to oxygenating Cyan, deep Blue, and all the way to pure White for advanced rounds.
- **🔊 Audio & Haptics:** Precise audio cues for inhaling, exhaling, and breath holds, paired with native haptic vibrations (on supported mobile devices) for eyes-closed sessions.
- **⚙️ Fully Customizable:** - Preparation time
  - Number of rounds & breaths per round
  - Breathing pace (inhale/exhale duration)
  - Retention (hold) times and recovery breaths
- **📶 100% Offline Ready (PWA):** Powered by Google Workbox. Install it on your phone's home screen or desktop and use it in the middle of a forest—no internet required.
- **📱 Cross-Platform:** Built with React Native. Runs seamlessly in the web browser, but can be easily compiled to native Android (.apk/.aab) and iOS apps.
